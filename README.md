The AXR Project
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally
improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked
together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and
presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the
presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS,
but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object
orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics,
references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.
